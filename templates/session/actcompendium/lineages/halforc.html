    <h1>HALF-ORCS</h1>
    <h2>Player's Handbook</h2>
    <p>
        <i><b>
        When alliances between humans and orcs are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, while others venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.
