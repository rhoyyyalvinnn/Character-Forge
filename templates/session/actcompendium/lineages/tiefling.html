    <h1>TIEFLINGS</h1>

        <i><b>
        To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. Their appearance and their nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children will always be held accountable.
