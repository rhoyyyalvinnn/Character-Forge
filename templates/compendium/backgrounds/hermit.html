    <h4>Life of Seclusion</h4>
    <p><i>What was the reason for your isolation, and what changed to allow you to end your solitude? You can work with your DM to determine the exact nature of your seclusion, or you can choose to roll on the table below to determine the reason behind your seclusion.</i></p>

    </div>

    <h4>Discovery</h4>
    <p><i>The quiet seclusion of your extended hermitage gave you access to a unique and powerful discovery. The exact nature of this revelation depends on the nature of your seclusion. It might be a great truth about the cosmos, the deities, the powerful beings of the outer planes, or the forces of nature. It could be a site that no one else has ever seen. You might have uncovered a fact that has long been forgotten, or unearthed some relic of the past that could rewrite history. It might be information that would be damaging to the people who or consigned you to exile, and hence the reason for your return to society.</i></p>

    <p><i>Work with your DM to determine the details of your discovery and its impact on the campaign.</i></p>

    <h3>Suggested Characteristics</h3>
    <p><i>Some hermits are well suited to a life of seclusion, whereas others chafe against it and long for company. Whether they embrace solitude or long to escape it, the solitary life shapes their attitudes and ideals. A few are driven slightly mad by their years apart from society.</i></p>

    <h3>Other Hermits</h3>
    <p><i>This hermit background assumes a contemplative sort of seclusion that allows room for study and prayer. If you want to play a rugged wilderness recluse who lives off the land while shunning the company of other people, look at the Outlander background. On the other hand, if you want to go in a more religious direction, the Acolyte might be what you're looking for. Or you could even be a Charlatan, posing as a wise and holy person and letting pious fools support you.</i></p>
